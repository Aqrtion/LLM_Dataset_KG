Abstract

We introduce UCF101 which is currently the largest dataset of human actions. It consists of 101 action classes, over 13k clips and 27 hours of video data. The database consists of realistic user-uploaded videos containing camera motion and cluttered background. Additionally, we provide baseline action recognition results on this new dataset using standard bag of words approach with overall performance of 44.5%. To the best of our knowledge, UCF101 is currently the most challenging dataset of actions due to its large number of classes, large number of clips and also unconstrained nature of such clips.

1. Introduction

The majority of existing action recognition datasets suffer from two disadvantages: 1) The number of their classes is typically very low compared to the richness of performed actions by humans in reality, e.g. KTH [11], Weizmann [3], UCF Sports [10], IXMAS [12] datasets includes only 6, 9, 9, 11 classes respectively. 2) The videos are recorded in unrealistically controlled environments. For instance, KTH, Weizmann, IXMAS are staged by actors; HOHA [7] and UCF Sports are composed of movie clips captured by professional ﬁlming crew. Recently, web videos have been used in order to utilize unconstrained user-uploaded data to alleviate the second issue [6, 8, 9, 5]. However, the ﬁrst disadvantage remains unresolved as the largest existing dataset does not include more than 51 actions while several works showedthatthenumberofclassesplayacrucialroleinevaluating an action recognition method [4, 9]. Therefore, we have compiled a new dataset with 101 actions and 13320 clips which is nearly twice bigger than the largest existing dataset in terms of number of actions and clips. (HMDB51 [5] and UCF50 [9] are the currently the largest ones with 6766 clips of 51 actions and 6681 clips of 50 actions respectively.)

The dataset

is composed of web videos which are recorded in unconstrained environments and typically in-

Clip Groups: The clips of one action class are divided into 25 groups which contain 4-7 clips each. The clips in one group share some common features, such as the background or actors.

The bar chart of Fig. 3 shows the number of clips in each class. The colors on each bar illustrate the durations of different clips included in that class. The chart shown in Fig. 4 illustrates the average clip length (green) and total duration of clips (blue) for each action class.

The videos are downloaded from YouTube [2] and the irrelevant ones are manually removed. All clips have ﬁxed frame rate and resolution of 25 FPS and 320 × 240 respectively. The videos are saved in .avi ﬁles compressed using DivX codec available in k-lite package [1]. The audio is preserved for the clips of the new 51 actions. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the dataset.

3. Experimental Results

We performed an experiment using bag of words approach which is widely accepted as a standard action recognition method to provide baseline results on UCF101.

From each clip, we extracted Harris3D corners (using the implementation by [7]) and computed 162 dimensional HOG/HOF descriptors for each. We clustered a randomly selected set of 100,000 space-time interest points (STIP) using k-means to build the codebook. The size of our codebook is k=4000 which is shown to yield good results over a wide range of datasets. The descriptors were assigned to their closest video words using nearest neighbor classiﬁer, and each clip was represented by a 4000-dimensional histogram of its words. Utilizing a leave-one-group-out 25- fold cross validation scenario, a SVM was trained using

the histogram vectors of the training folds. We employed a nonlinear multiclass SVM with histogram intersection kernel and 101 classes each representing one action. For testing, a similar histogram representation for the query video was computed and classiﬁed using the trained SVM. This method yielded an overall accuracy of 44.5%; The confusion matrix for all 101 actions is shown in Fig. 5.

The accuracy for

the predeﬁned action types are: Sports (50.54%), Playing Musical Instrument (37.42%), Human-Object Interaction (38.52%), Body-Motion Only (36.26%), Human-Human Interaction (44.14%). Sports actions achieve the highest accuracy since performing sports typically requires distinctive motions which makes the classiﬁcation easier. Moreover, the background in sports clips are generally less cluttered compared to other action types. Unlike Sports Actions, Human-Object Interaction clips typically have a highly cluttered background. Additionally, the informative motions typically occupy a small portion of the motions in the clips which explains the low recognition accuracy of this action class.

We recommend a 25-fold cross validation experimental setup using all the videos in the dataset to keep consistency of the reported tests on UCF101; the baseline results provided in this section were computed using the same scenario.

4. Related Datasets

UCF Sports, UCF11, UCF50 and UCF101 are the four action datasets compiled by UCF in chronological order; each one includes its precursor. We made two minor modiﬁcations in the portion of UCF101 which includes UCF50 videos: the number of groups is ﬁxed to 25 for all the actions, and each group includes up to 7 clips. Table 2 shows a list of existing action recognition datasets with detailed characteristics of each. Note that UCF101 is remarkably larger than the rest.

5. Conclusion

We introduced UCF101 which is the most challenging dataset for action recognition compared to the existing ones. It includes 101 action classes and over 13k clips which makes it outstandingly larger than other datasets. UCF101 is composed of unconstrained videos downloaded from YouTube which feature challenges such as poor lighting, cluttered background and severe camera motion. We provided baseline action recognition results on this new dataset using standard bag of words method with overall accuracy of 44.5%.
