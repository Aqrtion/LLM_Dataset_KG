Parkhi and Andrew Zisserman Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford {qiong,lishen,weidi,omkar,az}@robots.ox.ac.uk\nAbstract—In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale face dataset named VGGFace2. The dataset contains 3.31 million images of 9131 subjects, with an average of 362.6 images for each subject. Images are downloaded from Google Image Search and have large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession (e.g. actors, athletes, politicians).\nThe dataset was collected with three goals in mind: (i) to have both a large number of identities and also a large number of images for each identity; (ii) to cover a large range of pose, age and ethnicity; and (iii) to minimise the label noise. We describe how the dataset was collected, in particular the automated and manual ﬁltering stages to ensure a high accuracy for the images of each identity.\nTo assess face recognition performance using the new dataset, we train ResNet-50 (with and without Squeeze-andExcitation blocks) Convolutional Neural Networks on VGGFace2, on MS-Celeb-1M, and on their union, and show that training on VGGFace2 leads to improved recognition performance over pose and age. Finally, using the models trained on these datasets, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the face recognition of IJB datasets, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. The dataset and models are publicly available1.\nKeywords-face dataset; face recognition; convolutional neural\nnetworks\nI. INTRODUCTION\nConcurrent with the rapid development of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), there has been much recent effort in collecting large scale datasets to feed these datahungry models. In general, recent datasets (see Table I) have explored the importance of intra- and inter-class variations. The former focuses on depth (many images of one subject) and the latter on breadth (many subjects with limited images per subject). However, none of these datasets was speciﬁcally designed to explore pose and age variation. We address that here by designing a dataset generation pipeline to explicitly collect images with a wide range of pose, age, illumination and ethnicity variations of human faces.\nWe make the following four contributions: ﬁrst, we have collected a new large scale dataset, VGGFace2, for public release. It includes over nine thousand identities with between 80 and 800 images for each identity, and more than 3M images in total; second, a dataset generation pipeline is proposed that encourages pose and age diversity for each subject, and also involves multiple stages of automatic and\n1http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/∼vgg/data/vgg face2/\n978-1-5386-2335-0/18/$31.00 c(cid:13)2018 IEEE\nmanual ﬁltering in order to minimise label noise; third, we provide template annotation for the test set to explicitly explore pose and age recognition performance; and, ﬁnally, we show that training deep CNNs on the new dataset substantially exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on the IJB benchmark datasets [13], [14], [23]. In particular, we experiment with the recent Squeeze and Excitation network [9], and also investigate the beneﬁts of ﬁrst pretraining on a dataset with breadth (MS-Celeb-1M [7]) and then ﬁne tuning on VGGFace2.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows: We review in Section II, and give a summary of previous dataset in Table I. Section III gives an existing public dataset overview of the new dataset, and describes the template annotation for recognition over pose and age. Section IV describes the dataset collection process. Section V reports state-of-the-art performance of several different architectures on the IJB-A [13], IJB-B [23] and IJB-C [14] benchmarks.\nII. DATASET REVIEW In this section we brieﬂy review the principal “in the wild” datasets that have appeared recently. In 2007, the Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset [10] was released, containing 5,749 identities with 13,000 images.\nThe CelebFaces+ dataset [21] was released in 2014, with 202,599 images of 10,177 celebrities. The CASIA-WebFace dataset [26] released the same year that has 494,414 images of 10,575 people. The VGGFace dataset [17] released in 2015 has 2.6 million images covering 2,622 people, making it amongst the largest publicly available datasets. The curated version, where label noise is removed by human annotators, has 800,000 images with approximately 305 images per identity. Both the CASIA-WebFace and VGGFace datasets were released for training purposes only.\nMegaFace dataset [12] was released in 2016 to evaluate face recognition methods with up to a million distractors in the gallery image set. It contains 4.7 million images of 672,057 identities as the training set. However, an average of only 7 images per identity makes it restricted in its per identity face variation. In order to study the effect of pose and age variations in recognising faces, the MegaFace challenge [12] uses the subsets of FaceScrub [15] containing 4,000 images from 80 identities and FG-NET [16] containing 975 images from 82 identities for evaluation.\nMicrosoft released the large Ms-Celeb-1M dataset [7] in 2016 with 10 million images from 100k celebrities for\nDatasets LFW [10] YTF [24] CelebFaces+ [21] CASIA-WebFace [26] IJB-A [13] IJB-B [23] IJB-C [14] VGGFace [17] MegaFace [12] MS-Celeb-1M [7] UMDFaces [5] UMDFaces-Videos [4] VGGFace2 (this paper)\n# of subjects 5,749 1,595 10,177 10,575 500 1,845 3,531 2,622 690,572 100,000 8,501 3,107 9,131\n# of images 13,233 3,425 videos 202,599 494,414 5,712 images, 2,085 videos 11,754 images, 7,011 videos 31,334 images, 11,779 videos 2.6 M 4.7 M 10 M 367,920 22,075 videos 3.31 M\n# of images per subject manual identity labelling\n- - - - - - - - - - Yes - Yes\npose - - - - - - - - - - Yes - Yes\nage - - - - - - - Yes - - Yes - Yes\nyear 2007 2011 2014 2014 2015 2017 2018 2015 2016 2016 2016 2017 2018\nTable I: Statistics for recent public face datasets.

However, it has two limitations: (i) while it has the largest number of training images, the intra-identity variation is somewhat restricted due to an average of 81 images per person; (ii) images in the training set were directly retrieved from a search engine without manual ﬁltering, and consequently there is label noise. The IARPA Janus Benchmark-A (IJB-A) [13], Benchmark-B (IJB-B) [23] and Benchmark-C (IJB-C) [14] datasets were released as evaluation benchmarks (only test) for face detection, recognition and clustering in images and videos.\nUnlike the above datasets which are geared towards image-based face recognition, the Youtube Face (YTF) [24] and UMDFaces-Videos [4] datasets aim to recognise faces in unconstrained videos. YTF contains 1,595 identities and 3,425 videos, whilst UMDFaces-Videos is larger with 3,107 identities and 22,075 videos (the identities are a subset of those in UMDFaces [5]).\nApart form these public datasets, Facebook and Google have large in-house datasets. For instance, Facebook [22] trained a face identiﬁcation model using 500 million images of over 10 million subjects. The face recognition model by Google [19] was trained using 200 million images of 8 million identities.\nIII. AN OVERVIEW OF THE VGGFACE2\nA. Dataset Statistics\nThe VGGFace2 dataset contains 3.31 million images from 9131 celebrities spanning a wide range of ethnicities, e.g. it includes more Chinese and Indian faces than VGGFace (though, the ethnic balance is still limited by the distribution of celebrities and public ﬁgures), and professions (e.g. politicians and athletes). The Images were downloaded from Google Image Search and show large variations in pose, age, lighting and background. The dataset is approximately gender-balanced, with 59.3% males, varying between 80 and 843 images for each identity, with 362.6 images on average. It includes human veriﬁed bounding boxes around faces, and ﬁve ﬁducial keypoints predicted by the model of [27]. In addition, pose (yaw, pitch and roll) and apparent\nage information are estimated by our pre-trained pose and age classiﬁers (Pose, age statistics and example images are shown in Figure 1).\nThe dataset is divided into two splits: one for training having 8631 classes, and one for evaluation (test) with 500 classes.\nB. Pose and Age Annotations\nThe VGGFace2 provides annotation to enable evaluation on two scenarios: face matching across different poses, and face matching across different ages. Pose templates. A template here consists of ﬁve faces from the same subject with a consistent pose. This pose can be frontal, three-quarter or proﬁle view. For a subset of 300 subjects of the evaluation set, two templates (5 images per template) are provided for each pose view. Consequently there are 1.8K templates with 9K images in total. An examples is shown in Figure 2 (left).\nAge templates. A template here consists of ﬁve faces from the same subject with either an apparent age below 34 (deemed young), or 34 or above (deemed mature). These are provided for a subset of 100 subjects from the evaluation set with two templates for each age period, therefore, there are 400 templates with a total of 2K images. Examples are show in Figure 2 (right).\nIV. DATASET COLLECTION\nIn this section, we describe the dataset collection process, including: how a list of candidate identities was obtained; how candidate images were collected; and, how the dataset was cleaned up both automatically and manually. The process is summarised in Table II.\nA. Stage 1: Obtaining and selecting a name list\nWe use a similar strategy to that proposed by [17]. The ﬁrst stage is to ﬁnd as many subjects as possible that have a sufﬁciently distinct set of images available, for example, celebrities and public ﬁgures (e.g. actors, politicians and athletes). An initial list of 500k public ﬁgures is obtained from the Freebase knowledge graph [2].\nAn annotator team is then used to remove identities from the candidate list that do not have sufﬁcient distinct\n(a) pose statistics\n(b) age statistics\n(c) John Wesley Shipp\n(d) Leymah Gbowee\n(e) Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein\n(f) Julio C´esar Ch´avez Jr.\n(g) Roy Jones Jr.\n(h) Ruby Lin\n(i) Additi Gupta\n(j) Lee Joon-gi\nFigure 1: (a-b) VGGFace2 poses and ages statistics.

To this end, for each of the 500K names, 100 images are downloaded using Google Image Search and human annotators are instructed to retain subjects for which approximately 90% or more of the 100 images belong to a single identity. This removes candidates who do not have sufﬁcient images or for which Google Image Search returns a mix of people for a single name. In this manner, we reduce the candidates to only 9244 names. Attribute information such as ethnicity and kinship is obtained from DBPedia [1].\nB. Stage 2: Obtaining images for each identity\nWe query in Google Image Search and download 1000 images for each subject. To obtain images with large pose and age variations, we then append the keyword ‘sideview’ and ‘very young’ to each name and download 200 images for each. This results in 1400 images for each identity.\nC. Stage 3: Face detection\nFaces are detected using the model provided by [27]. We use the hyper-parameters recommended in that work to favor a good trade-off between precision and recall. The\nFigure 2: VGGFace2 template examples.

Right: age templates for two subjects for young and mature ages (arranged by row).\nface bounding box is then extended by a factor of 0.3 to include the whole head. Moreover, ﬁve facial landmarks are predicted by the same model.\nwith another class in the dataset. This stage addresses these two types of errors with a mix of manual and automated algorithms.\nD. Stage 4: Automatic ﬁltering by classiﬁcation\nThe aim of this stage is to remove outlier faces for each identity automatically. This is achieved by learning a classiﬁer to identify the faces, and removing possible erroneous faces below a classiﬁcation score. To this end, 1-vs-rest classiﬁers are trained to discriminate between the 9244 subjects. Speciﬁcally, faces from the top 100 retrieved images of each identity are used as positives, and the top 100 of all other identities are used as negative for training. The face descriptor features are obtained from the VGGFace [17] model. Then, the scores (between 0 and 1) from the trained model is used to sort images for each subject from most likely to least likely. By manually checking through images from a random 500 subjects, we choose a threshold of 0.5 and remove any faces below this.\nE. Stage 5: Near duplicate removal\nThe downloaded images also contain exact or near duplicates due to the same images being found at different internet locations, or images differing only slightly in colour balance or JPEG artifacts for example. To alleviate this, duplicate images are removed by clustering VLAD descriptors for all images remaining at stage 4 and only retaining one image per cluster [3], [11].\nF. Stage 6: Final automatic and manual ﬁltering\nAt this point, two types of error may still remain: ﬁrst, some classes still have outliers (i.e. images that do not belong to the person); and second, some classes contain a mixture of faces of more than one person, or they overlap\nDetecting overlapped subjects. Subjects may overlap with other subjects. For instance, ‘Will I Am’ and ‘William James Adams’ in the candidate list refer to the same person. To detect confusions for each class, we randomly split the data for each class in half: half for training and the other for testing. Then, we train a ResNet-50 [8] and generate a confusion matrix by calculating top-1 error on the test samples. In this manner, we ﬁnd 20 subjects confused with others. In this stage, we removed 19 noisy classes. In addition, we remove 94 subjects with samples less than 80 images, which results in a ﬁnal list of 9131 identities.\nRemoving outlier images for a subject. The aim of this is to achieve a purity ﬁltering, which is partly manual, greater than 96%. We found that for some subjects, images with very high classiﬁer scores at stage 4 can also be noisy. This happens when the downloaded images contain couples or band members who always appear together in public. In this case, the classiﬁers trained with these mixed examples at stage 4 tend to fail.\nWe retrain the model based on the current dataset, and for each identity the classiﬁer score is used to divide the images into 3 sets: H (i.e. high score range [1, 0.95]), I (i.e. intermediate score range (0.95, 0.8]) and L (i.e. low score range (0.8, 0.5]). Human annotators clean up the images for each subject based on their scores, and the actions they carry out depends on whether the set H is noisy or not. If the set (H) contains several different people (noise) in a single identity folder, then set I and L (which have lower\nconﬁdence scores), will undoubtedly be noisy as well, so all three sets are cleaned manually. In contrast, if set H is clean, then only set L (the lowest scores which is supposed to be the most noisy set) is cleaned up. After this, a new model is trained on the cleaned set H and L, and set I (intermediate scores, noise level is also intermediate) is then cleaned by model prediction. This procedure achieves very low label noise without requiring manual checking of every image.\nG. Pose and age annotations\nWe train two networks to obtain the pose and age information for the dataset. To obtain head pose (roll, pitch, yaw), a 5-way classiﬁcation ResNet-50 [8] is trained on the CASIA-WebFace dataset [26]. Then, this trained model is used to predict pose for all the images in the dataset.\nSimilarly, to estimate the apparent age, a 8-way classiﬁcation ResNet-50 [8] is trained on IMDB-WIKI - 500k+ dataset [18]. Ages of faces are then predicted by this model.\nV. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we evaluate the quality of the VGGFace2 dataset by conducting a number of baseline experiments. We report the results on the VGGFace2 test set, and evaluate on the public benchmarks IJB datasets [13], [14], [23]. The subjects in our training dataset are disjoint with the ones in benchmark datasets. We also remove the overlap between MS-Celeb-1M and the two benchmarks when training the networks.\nA. Experimental setup\nArchitecture. ResNet-50 [8] and SE-ResNet-50 [9] (SENet for short) are used as the backbone architectures for the comparison amongst training datasets. The Squeeze-andExcitation (SE) blocks [9] adaptively recalibrate channelwise feature responses by explicitly modelling channel relationships. They can be integrated with modern architectures, such as ResNet, and improve its representational power. This has been demonstrated for object and scene classiﬁ- cation, with a Squeeze-and-Excitation network winning the ILSVRC 2017 classiﬁcation competition.\n(a) networks\nThe following experiments are developed under four settings: learned from scratch on VGGFace [17] (VF for short); (b) networks are learned from scratch on MS-Celeb-1M (MS1M for short) [7]; (c) networks are learned from scratch on VGGFace2 (VF2 for short); and, (d) networks are ﬁrst pre-trained on MS1M, and then ﬁne-tuned on VGGFace2 (VF2 ft for short).\nSimilarity computation. In all the experiments (i.e. for both veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation), we need to compute templates. A template is the similarity between subject represented by a single vector computed by aggregating the face descriptors of each face in the template set. In section V-B, the template vector is obtained by averaging\nthe face descriptors of the images and SVM classiﬁers are used for identiﬁcation. In sections V-C and V-D for IJBA and IJB-B, where the template may contain both still images and video frames, we ﬁrst compute the media vector (i.e. from images or video frames) by averaging the face descriptors in that media. A template vector is then generated by averaging the media vectors in that template, which is then L2 normalised. Cosine similarity is used to represent the similarity between two templates.\nA face descriptor is obtained from the trained networks as follows: ﬁrst the extended bounding box of the face is resized so that the shorter side is 256 pixels; then the centre 224 × 224 crop of the face image is used as input is extracted from to the network. The face descriptor from the layer adjacent to the classiﬁer layer. This leads to a 2048 dimensional descriptor, which is then L2 normalised.\nTraining implementation details. All the networks are trained for classiﬁcation using the soft-max loss function. During training, the extended bounding box of the face is resized so that the shorter side is 256 pixels, then a 224×224 pixels region is randomly cropped from each sample. The mean value of each channel is subtracted for each pixel.\nMonochrome augmentation is used with a probability of 20% to reduce the over-ﬁtting on colour images. Stochastic gradient descent is used with mini-batches of size 256, with a balancing-sampling strategy for each mini-batch due to the unbalanced training distributions. The initial learning rate is 0.1 for the models trained from scratch, and this is decreased twice with a factor of 10 when errors plateau. The weights of the models are initialised as described in [8]. The learning rate for model ﬁne-tuning starts from 0.005 and decreases to 0.001.\nB. Experiments on the new dataset\nIn this section, we evaluate ResNet-50 trained from scratch on the three datasets as described in the Sec. V-A, and VGGFace2 test set. We test identiﬁcation performance and also similarity over pose and age, and validate the capability of VGGFace2 to tackle pose and age variations.\nFace identiﬁcation. This scenario aims to predict, for a given test image, whose face it is. Speciﬁcally, for each of the 500 subjects in the evaluation set, 50 images are randomly chosen as the testing split and the remaining images are used as the training split. This training split is used to learn 1-vs-rest SVM classiﬁers for each subject. A top-1 classiﬁcation error is then used to evaluate the performance of these classiﬁers on the test images. As shown in Table III, there is a signiﬁcant improvement for the model trained on VGGFace2 rather than on VGGFace. This demonstrates the beneﬁt of increasing data variation (e.g, subject number, pose and age variations) in the VGGFace2 training dataset. More importantly, models\ntrained on VGGFace2 also achieve better result than that on MS1M even though it has tenfold more subjects and threefold more images, demonstrating the good quality of VGGFace2. the very low top-1 error of VGGFace2 provides evidence that there is very little label noise in the dataset – which is one of our design goals.\nIn particular,\nTraining dataset Top-1 error (%)\nVGGFace MS1M VGGFace2 5.6\nTable III: Identiﬁcation performance (top-1 classiﬁcation error) on the VGGFace2 test set for ResNet models trained on different datasets. A lower value is better.\nProbing across pose. This test aims to assess how well templates match across three pose views: front, three-quarter and proﬁle views. As described in section III-B, 300 subjects in the evaluation set are annotated with pose templates, and there are six templates for each subject: two each for front, three-quarter view and proﬁle views.\nTable IV compares\nThese six templates are divided into two sets, one pose for each set, and a 3 × 3 similarity matrix is constructed between the two sets. Figure 4 visualises two example of these cosine similarity scores for front-to-proﬁle templates. the similarity matrix averaged over the 300 subjects. We can observe that (i) all the three models perform better when matching similar poses, i.e., front-to-front, three-quarter-to-three-quarter and the performance drops when proﬁle-to-proﬁle; and (ii) probing for different poses, e.g., front-to-three-quarter and front-to-proﬁle, showing that recognition across poses is a much harder problem. Figure 3 shows histograms of similarity scores. It the mass of the is evident is to the right of the MS1M VGGFace2 trained model and VGGFace trained models. This clearly demonstrates the beneﬁt of training on a dataset with larger pose variation.\nProbing across age. This test aims to assess how well templates match across age, for two ages ranges: young and mature ages. As described in section III-B, 100 subjects in the evaluation set are annotated with age templates, and there are four templates for each subject: two each for young and mature faces.\nFor each subject a 2 × 2 similarity matrix is computed, where an element is the cosine similarity between two templates. Figure 6 shows two examples of the young-tomature templates, and their similarity scores.\nTable V compares the similarity matrix averaged over the 100 subjects as the model changes. For all the three models, there is always a big drop in performance when matching across young and mature faces, which reveals that young-to-mature matching is substantially more challenging than young-to-young and mature-to-mature. Moreover,\nyoung-to-young matching is more difﬁcult than mature-tomature matching. Figure 5 illustrates the histograms of the young-to-mature template similarity scores.\nDiscussion. In the evaluation of pose and age protocols, models trained on VGGFace2 always achieve the highest similarity scores, and MS1M dataset the lowest. This can be explained by the fact that the MS1M dataset is designed to focus more on inter-class diversities, and this harms the matching performance across different pose and age, illustrating the value of VGGFace2 in having more intraclass diversities that cover large variations in pose and age. Figure 7 shows the top 3 and bottom 3 front-to-proﬁle template matches sorted using the similarity scores produced by the ResNet model trained on VGGFace2. We can observe that the model gives high scores to front-to-proﬁle templates where there is little variation beyond pose; while it gives lower scores to templates where many other variations exist, such as expression and resolution.\nFigure 8 shows the top 3 and bottom 3 young-to-mature template matches sorted using the similarity scores produced trained on VGGFace2. It can be by the ResNet model seen that the model gives low scores to young-to-mature templates where variations such as pose and occlusion exist.\nC. Experiments on IJB-A\nIn this section, we compare the performance of the models trained on the different datasets on the public IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A dataset) [13].\nThe IJB-A dataset contains 5712 images and 2085 videos from 500 subjects, with an average of 11.4 images and 4.2 videos per subject. All images and videos are captured from unconstrained environment and show large variations in expression and image qualities. As a pre-processing, we detect the faces using MTCNN [27] to keep the cropping consistent between training and evaluation.\nIJB-A provides ten-split evaluations with two standard protocols, namely, 1:1 face veriﬁcation and 1:N face identiﬁcation, where we directly extract the features from the models for the test sets and use cosine similarity score. For veriﬁcation, the performance is reported using the true accept rates (TAR) vs. false positive rates (FAR) (i.e. curve). For identiﬁcation, the performance is reported using the true positive identiﬁcation rate (TPIR) vs. false positive identiﬁcation rate (FPIR) (equivalent to a decision error trade-off (DET) curve) and the Rank-N (i.e. the cumulative match characteristic (CMC) curve). Table VI and Figure 9 presents the comparison results.\nreceiver operating characteristics\nThe effect of training set.

Moreover, the model of VGGFace2 is signiﬁcantly superior to the one of MS1M which has 10 times subjects over our dataset. Specially, it achieve ∼ 4.4% improvement over MS1M on FAR=0.001 for veriﬁcation, ∼ 3.7% on FPIR=0.01 and ∼ 1.5% on Rank-1 for identiﬁcation.\nWhen comparing with the results of existing works, the model trained on VGGFace2 surpasses previously reported results on all metrics (best to our knowledge, reported on IJB-A 1:1 veriﬁcation and 1:N identiﬁcation protocols), which further demonstrate the advantage of the VGGFace2 dataset. In addition, the generalisation power can be further improved by ﬁrst training with MS1M and then ﬁne-tuning with VGGFace2 (i.e. “VGGFace2 ft”), however, the difference is only 0.908 vs. 0.895.\nFigure 6: Two example templates of young-to-mature matching. Left: the similarity scores produced by VGGFace, MS1M, VGGFace2 are 0.42, 0.30 and 0.58, respectively; Right: the scores are 0.43, 0.41 and 0.73, respectively.\nFigure 7: Top 3 and bottom 3 front-to-proﬁle template matches sorted using the similarity score produced by a ResNet model trained on VGGFace2.

We next investigate the effect of architectures trained on VGGFace2 (Table VI). The comparison between ResNet-50 and SENet both learned from scratch reveals that SENet has a consistently superior performance on both veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation. More importantly, SENet trained from scratch achieves comparable results to the ﬁne-turned ResNet-50 (i.e. ﬁrst pre-trained on the MS1M dataset), demonstrating that the diversity of our dataset can be further exploited by an advanced network. In addition, the performance of SENet can be further improved by training on the two datasets VGGFace2 and MS1M, exploiting the different advantages that each offer.\nD. Experiments on IJB-B\nThe IJB-B dataset is an extension of IJB-A, having 1,845 subjects with 21.8K still images (including 11,754 face and 10,044 non-face) and 55K frames from 7,011 videos. We evaluate the models on the standard 1:1 veriﬁcation protocol (matching between the Mixed Media probes and two galleries) and 1:N identiﬁcation protocol (1:N Mixed Media probes across two galleries).\nWe observe a similar behaviour to that of the IJB-A evaluation. For the comparison between different training sets (Table VII and Figure 10), the models trained on VGGFace2 signiﬁcantly surpass the ones trained on MS1M, and the performance can be further improved by integrating the advantages of the two datasets. In addition, SENet’s superiority over ResNet-50 is evident in both veriﬁcation and\nidentiﬁcation with the two training settings (i.e. trained from scratch and ﬁne-tuned). Moreover, we also compare to the results reported by others on the benchmark [23] (as shown in Table VII), and there is a considerable improvement over their performance for all measures.\nE. Experiments on IJB-C\nThe IJBC dataset is a further extension of IJB-B, including 3531 subjects with 31.3K still images and 117.5K frames from 11,779 videos. We evaluate the models on the standard 1:1 veriﬁcation protocol and 1:N identiﬁcation protocol. Results are shown in Table VIII and Figure 11. Compared to the results reported in there is a considerable improvement for all measures.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we have proposed a pipeline for collecting a high-quality dataset, VGGFace2, with a wide range of pose and age. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deep models (ResNet-50 and SENet) trained on VGGFace2, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the IJB-A, IJB-B and IJBC benchmarks. The dataset and models are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/∼vgg/data/vgg face2/.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank Elancer and Momenta for their part in preparing the dataset2.
