It is also useful for multilingual system development and comparative linguistic studies. Universal Dependencies is an open community effort to create cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation for many languages within a dependency-based lexicalist framework. In this paper, we describe v1 of the universal guidelines, the underlying design principles, and the currently available treebanks for 33 languages.\nKeywords:treebanks, dependency, annotation, multilingual, cross-linguistic, universal.\nIntroduction\nMultilingual research on syntax and parsing has for a long time been hampered by the fact that annotation schemes vary enormously across languages, which has made it virtually impossible to perform sound comparative evaluations and cross-lingual learning experiments. A striking illustration of this problem can be found in Figure 1, which shows three parallel sentences in Swedish, Danish and English, annotated according to the guidelines of the Swedish Treebank (Nivre and Megyesi, 2007), the Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann, 2003), and Stanford Typed Dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006), respectively. The syntactic structure is identical in the three languages, but the percentage of shared dependency relations across pairs of languages is at most 40% (and 0% across all three languages). As a consequence, a parser trained on one type of annotation and evaluated on another type will be found to have at least a 60% error rate when it functions perfectly.\nTheUniversalDependencies(UD)projectseekstotackle this problem by developing cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation for many languages, aiming to capture similarities as well as idiosyncracies among typologically different languages (e.g., morphologically rich languages, pro-drop languages, and languages featuring clitic doubling). In this way, we hope to be able not only to support comparative evaluation and cross-lingual learning but also to facilitate multilingual natural language processing and enable comparative linguistic studies. To serve all these purposes, the framework needs to have a solid linguistic foundation and at the same time be transparent and accessible to non-specialists.\nSeveral separate initiatives exist to build consistent resources for many languages, and the UD project is a merger of some of the initiatives. It combines the (universal) Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006; de Marneffe and Manning, 2008; de Marneffe et al., 2014), the universal\nkatt nsubj\nr˚attor\nrotter\nchases\nFigure 1: Divergent annotation of parallel structures\nGoogle dependency scheme (Universal Dependency Treebanks) (McDonald et al., 2013), the Google universal partof-speech tags (Petrov et al., 2012), and the Interset interlingua for morphosyntactic tag sets (Zeman, 2008) used in the HamleDT treebanks (a project that transforms existing treebanks under a common annotation scheme, Zeman et al. 2012). UD is thus based on common usage and existing de facto standards, and is intended to replace all the previous versions by a single coherent standard.1 The general philosophy is to provide a universal inventory of categories and guidelines to facilitate consistent annotation of similar constructions across languages, while allowing languagespeciﬁc extensions when necessary.\nIn this paper, we present version 1 of the universal guidelines and explain the underlying design principles. We give an overview of the 37 treebanks that constitute the latest release (v1.2), representing 33 different languages, and conclude with a few words about the future of the project. Guidelines for speciﬁc languages can be found at http://universaldependencies.org.\n1The UDT project has been deprecated and redirects to UD. HamleDT still exists as an independent project but uses the UD standard from version 3.0.\nadvmod\nToutefois toutefois\nADV PUNCT\nles le DET\nﬁlles ﬁlle NOUN\nadorent adorer VERB Deﬁnite=Def Gender=Fem Number=Plur Deﬁnite=Def Gender=Masc Person=3 Number=Plur Number=Plur Number=Plur Number=Plur Tense=Pres\ndesserts dessert NOUN\nles le DET\n`a `a ADP\nle le DET\nchocolat chocolat NOUN\n. .

        "UD comprises two layers of annotation with diverse origins. The Google universal tag set used in the morphological layer grew out of the cross-linguistic error analysis based on the CoNLL-X shared task data by McDonald and Nivre (2007). It was initially used for unsupervised partof-speech tagging by Das and Petrov (2011), and has been adopted as a widely used standard for mapping diverse tag sets to a common standard. The morphological layer also builds on Interset (Zeman, 2008), which started as a tool for conversion between morphosyntactic tag sets of multiple languages. It dates back to 2006 when it was used in the ﬁrst experiments with cross-lingual delexicalized parser adaptation (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). The Stanford dependencies, used in the syntactic layer, were developed for English in 2005 and eventually emerged as the de facto standard for dependency analysis of English. They have since been adapted to a number of different languages (Chang et al., 2009; Bosco et al., 2013; Haverinen et al., 2013; Seraji et al., 2013; Lipenkova and Souˇcek, 2014).",
        "3.4. Format and Tools The data is encoded in the CoNLL-U format, which is an evolution of the widely used CoNLL-X format (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), where each word/token is represented in tab-separated columns on one line and sentence boundaries aremarkedbyblanklines. The10columnsonaword/token line are used to specify a unique id (integer for words, ranges for multiword tokens), word form, lemma, universal part-of-speech tag, optional language-speciﬁc part-ofspeech tag, morphological features, head, dependency relation, additional dependencies in the enhanced representation and miscellaneous information. The format is illustrated in Figure 3, with the French sentence from Figure 2. To support work on treebanks in this format, we have introduced Python and JavaScript libraries for reading and validating CoNLL-U.3 The UD documentation efforts are supported by the Annodoc system4 (Pyysalo and Ginter, 2014), with annotation visualizations generated using brat",

While newswire is quite present, there are other genres well represented in several languages such as web data (reviews, blogs), ﬁction and legal documents. As indicated in Figure 5, the extent to which the data has been manually annotated or automatically converted from existing treebanks varies, and there is a continuing effort to further improve the consistency of the annotation across languages.",
