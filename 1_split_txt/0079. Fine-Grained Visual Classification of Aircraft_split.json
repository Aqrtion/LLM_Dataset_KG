At the ﬁner level, differences between models are often subtle but always visually measurable, making visual recognition challenging but possible. A benchmark is obtained by deﬁning corresponding classiﬁcation tasks and evaluation protocols, and baseline results are presented. The construction of this dataset was made possible by the work of aircraft enthusiasts, a strategy that can extend to the study of number of other object classes. Compared to the domains usually considered in ﬁne-grained visual classiﬁcation (FGVC), for example animals, aircraft are rigid and hence less deformable. They, however, present other interesting modes of variation, including purpose, size, designation, structure, historical style, and branding.\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper, we introduce FGVC-Aircraft, a novel datasetaimedatstudyingtheproblemofﬁne-grainedrecognition of aircraft models (Fig. 1, Sect. 2). The new data includes 10,000 airplane images spanning 100 different models, organised in a hierarchical manner. All models are visually distinguishable, even though in many cases the differences are subtle, making classiﬁcation challenging and interesting.\nAirplanes are an alternative to objects typically considered in ﬁne-grained visual classiﬁcation (FGVC) such as birds [5] and pets [2–4]. Compared to these domains, aircraft classiﬁcation has several interesting aspects. First, aircraft designs vary signiﬁcantly depending on the plane size (from home-built to large carriers), designation (private, civil, military), purpose (transporter, carrier, training, sport, ﬁghter, etc.), and technological factors such as propulsion (glider, propellor, jet). Overall, thousands of different airplane models exist or have existed. An interesting mode of variation, which is is not shared with categories such as animals, isthefactthatthestructureofaircraftcanchangewith\ntheir design. For example, the number of wings, undercarriages, wheels per undercarriage, engines, etc. varies. Second, the aircraft designs exhibit systematic historical variations in their style. Thirdly, the same aircraft models are used by different airliner companies, resulting in variable livery branding. Finally, aircraft are largely rigid objects, reducing the impact of deformability on classiﬁcation performance, and allowing one to focus on the other aspects of FGVC.\nOur contributions are three-fold: (i) we introduce a new large dataset of aircraft images with detailed model annotations; (ii) we describe how this data was collected using on-line resources and the work of hobbyists and enthusiasts – a method that may be applicable to other object classes; and (iii) we present baseline results on aircraft model identiﬁcation. Sect. 2 describes the content of FGVC-Aircraft, including task deﬁnitions and evaluation protocols, Sect. 3 the dataset construction, Sect. 4 examines the performance of a baseline classiﬁer on the data, and Sect. 5 summarises the contributions, giving further details on the data usage policy.",

        "• Variant. Model variants are the ﬁner distinction level that are visually detectable, and were obtained by merging visually indistinguishable models. For example, the variant Boeing 737-700 includes 87 models such as 737- 7H4, 737-76N, 737-7K2, etc. The dataset contains 100 variants.",

        "3. Dataset construction",
        "Identifying the detailed model of an aircraft from an image is challenging for anyone but aircraft experts, and collecting 10,000 such annotations is daunting in general. Sect. 3.1 explains how leveraging aircraft data collected by aircraft spotters was the key in the construction of FGVCAircraft. However, collecting data from a restricted number of sources presents its own challenges. Sect. 3.2 introduces a notion of diversity and applies it to select a subset of the data that is maximally uncorrelated. Sect. 3.3 explains how bounding box annotations were crowdsourced using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and Sect. 3.4 how the hierarchical labels were obtained.",
        "3.1. Initial data collection",
        "Enthusiasts, collectors, and other hobbyists may be an excellent source of annotated visual data. In particular, data obtained from aircraft spotters was instrumental in the construction of this FGVC-Aircraft. A large number of such annotated images is available online in Airliners.net (http://www.airliners.net/), a repository of air-",
        "craft spotting data (similar collections exists, for example, for cars and trains). While using such images for research purposes may be considered fair use, nevertheless we found appropriate to ask for explicit permission to the photographers due to the large quantity of data involved. Of about twenty photographers that were contacted, permission to use the data for research purposes was granted by about ten of them (Sect. 5.1), and an explicit negative answer was receivedonlyfromtwoofthem. FGVC-Aircraftcontainsdata only from the photographers that explicitly made their pictures available (see Sect. 2 and Sect. 5.1 for further details). About 70,000 images were downloaded from the ten photographers, resulting in images spanning thousands of different aircraft models. Even after grouping these models into variants, there was still a very large number of different classes, with a very skewed distribution. Popular families such as Airbus and Boeing included thousand of images per model variant, whereas rarer models counted only a dozen images. The 100 most frequent variants were retained, resulting in at least 120 images per variant.",
        "One drawback of relying on a small set of photographers is that unwanted correlation may be introduced in the data. While these photographers tend to be active in the span of several years, it is natural to expect at least regional de-",

        "pendencies (for example certain airliners may ﬂy more frequently to certain airports). Therefore, the data was ﬁrst ﬁltered to maximise internal diversity. Each pair of images for a given variant was compared based on photographer, time, airliner, and airport, obtaining an “a priori” similarity score (i.e., without looking at the pictures). Then, 100 images per variant were incrementally and greedily selected in order of decreasing diversity to the images already added to the collection. After doing so, images were randomly assigned to the training, validation, and test subsets. This simple procedure was effective at reducing internal correlation in the data, as reﬂected by a substantial reduction of the classiﬁcation performance of baseline classiﬁers. In particular, sequences of photos are broken whenever possible.",
        "would have introduced in the data.",
        "We consider the classiﬁcation tasks given in Sect. 2. For example, the variant classiﬁcation for our dataset is a 100- way binary classiﬁcation problem and performance is measured in term of class-normalised average accuracy as described earlier.",
        "We have introduced FGVC-Aircraft, a new large dataset of aircraft images for ﬁne-grained visual categorisation. The data contains 10,000 images, 100 airplane model variants, 70 families, and 30 manufacturers. We believe that FGVC-Aircraft has the potential of introducing aircraft recognition as a novel domain in FGVC to the wider computer vision community (FGVC-Aircraft will be part of the ImageNet 2013 FGVC challenge). Compared to other classes used frequently in FGVC, aircraft have different and interesting modes of variation.",
        "Images in FGVC-Aircraft were obtained from aircraft spotter collections, maximising internal diversity in order to reduce unwanted correlation between images taken by a limited number of photographers; in the future, we plan to substantially increase the size of the FGVC-Aircraft dataset by including more models as more and more photographers provide permission to use their photos, and apply the same construction to other object categories as well.",
