Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct dropin replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size, data format and the structure of training and testing splits. is freely available at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.\nThe dataset\n1 Introduction\nThe MNIST dataset comprising of 10-class handwritten digits, was ﬁrst introduced by LeCun et al. [1998] in 1998. At that time one could not have foreseen the stellar rise of deep learning techniques and their performance. Despite the fact that today deep learning can do so much the simple MNIST dataset has become the most widely used testbed in deep learning, surpassing CIFAR10 [Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009] and ImageNet [Deng et al., 2009] in its popularity via Google trends1. Despite its simplicity its usage does not seem to be decreasing despite calls for it in the deep learning community.\nThereasonMNISTis sopopularhastodowithits size, allowingdeeplearningresearcherstoquickly checkandprototypetheiralgorithms. Thisisalsocomplementedbythefactthatallmachinelearning libraries (e.g. scikit-learn) and deep learning frameworks (e.g. Tensorﬂow, Pytorch) provide helper functions and convenient examples that use MNIST out of the box.\nOur aim with this work is to create a good benchmark dataset which has all the accessibility of MNIST, namely its small size, straightforward encoding and permissive license. We took the approach of sticking to the 10 classes 70,000 grayscale images in the size of 28×28 as in the original MNIST. In fact, the only change one needs to use this dataset is to change the URL from where the MNIST dataset is fetched. Moreover, Fashion-MNIST poses a more challenging classiﬁcation task than the simple MNIST digits data, whereas the latter has been trained to accuracies above 99.7% as reported in Wan et al. [2013], Ciregan et al. [2012].\nWe also looked at the EMNIST dataset provided by Cohen et al. [2017], an extended version of MNIST thatextendsthe numberofclasses byintroducinguppercaseandlowercasecharacters.

        "Fashion-MNIST is based on the assortment on Zalando’s website2. Every fashion product on Zalando has a set of pictures shot by professional photographers, demonstrating different aspects of the product, i.e. front and back looks, details, looks with model and in an outﬁt. The original picture has a light-gray background (hexadecimal color: #fdfdfd) and stored in 762 × 1000 JPEG format. Forefﬁcientlyservingdifferentfrontendcomponents,the originalpictureis resampledwith multiple resolutions, e.g. large, medium, small, thumbnail and tiny. We use the front look thumbnail images of 70,000 unique products to build Fashion-MNIST. Those products come from different gender groups: men, women, kids and neutral. In particular, whitecolor products are not included in the dataset as they have low contrast to the background. The thumbnails (51 × 73) are then fed into the following conversion pipeline, which is visualized in Figure 1.",

        "Finally, the dataset is divided into a training and a test set. The training set receives a randomlyselected 6,000 examples from each class. Images and labels are stored in the same ﬁle format as the MNIST data set, which is designed for storing vectors and multidimensional matrices. The result ﬁles are listed in Table 1. We sort examples by their labels while storing, resulting in smaller label ﬁles after compression comparing to the MNIST. It is also easier to retrieve examples with a certain class label. The data shufﬂing job is therefore left to the algorithm developer.",
        "Table 2: Class names and example images in Fashion-MNIST dataset.",
        "We provide some classiﬁcation results in Table 3 to form a benchmark on this data set. All algorithms are repeated 5 times by shufﬂing the training data and the average accuracy on the test set is reported. The benchmark on the MNIST dataset is also included for a side-by-side comparison. A more comprehensive table with explanations on the algorithms can be found on https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.",
        "This paper introduced Fashion-MNIST, a fashion product images dataset intended to be a dropin replacement of MNIST and whilst providing a more challenging alternative for benchmarking machine learning algorithm. The images in Fashion-MNIST are converted to a format that matches that of the MNIST dataset, making it immediately compatible with any machine learning package capable of working with the original MNIST dataset.",
