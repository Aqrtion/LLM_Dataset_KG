Role:
Act as a knowledge graph fusion expert specializing in datasets used by Large Language Models (LLMs).

###

Context:
1. I have Knowledge JSON-formatted Graphs related to LLMs datasets extracted from research papers, structured with predefined schema.

   Predefined Entity Schema:
   - Paper: Formal research paper titles (e.g. "LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models")
   - Task: Research tasks related to large language model (LLM) technologies (e.g. "instruction tuning", "chain-of-thought reasoning")
   - Dataset: Formal names with versions (e.g. "The Pile v1.2", "RedPajama-Data-1T"), including dataset abbreviations in parentheses (e.g. "C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus)")
   - Repository: Dataset storage locations (e.g. "https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/pile", "https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T"). Exclude: Code repositories
   - License: Data usage licenses (e.g. "AI2 Impact License", "CC-BY-NC-4.0")

   Predefined Relation Schema:
   | Relation         | Valid Head   | Valid Tail   | Description                              |
   |------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
   | is_equivalent_to | Paper A      | Paper B      | Same name equivalence                    |
   | is_equivalent_to | Task A       | Task B       | Same or non-same name equivalence        |
   | is_equivalent_to | Dataset A    | Dataset B    | Same or non-same name equivalence        |
   | is_equivalent_to | Repository A | Repository B | Same name equivalence                    |
   | is_equivalent_to | License A    | License B    | Same name equivalence                    |
   | has_subtask      | Task A       | Task B       | Task A includes Task B as a subtask      |
   | has_new_version  | Dataset A    | Dataset B    | Dataset A has a new version of dataset B |

Task Description:
1. You will receive two sets of entities of the same type: one set consists of integrated entities, and the other set consists of non-integrated entities.
2. For any pair of entities, where Entity A comes from the integrated entities set and Entity B comes from the non-integrated entities set, identify the relationship between Entity A and Entity B.
3. For any given pair of entities, where both Entity A and Entity B come from the non-integrated entity set, identify the relationship between Entity A and Entity B.

Fusion Rules:
1. Paper Entities Fusion:
   Same name equivalence: Paper entity A and paper entity B have an "is_equivalent_to" relationship if their names and author attribute values are exactly the same.
2. Task Entities Fusion:
   (1) Same name equivalence: Task entity A and task entity B have an "is_equivalent_to" relationship if their names are exactly the same.
   (2) Non-same name equivalence: Task entity A and task entity B have an "is_equivalent_to" relation if their names are similar and the semantics of their definition attributes are similar.
   (3) Task A includes Task B as a subtask: Infer whether task A includes task B, if so, then there is A "has_subtask" relationship between task entity A and task entity B, where task entity A is the head entity and task entity B is the tail entity.
3. Dataset Entities Fusion:
   (1) Same name equivalence: Data set entity A and data set entity B have an "is_equivalent_to" relationship if their names are exactly the same, and they have similar attributes (There is no "is_equivalent_to" relationship between data set entity A and data set entity B if their version attribute values are different).
   (2) Non-same name equivalence: Data set entity A and data set entity B have an "is_equivalent_to" relationship if one of their names is a full name and the other is an abbreviation corresponding to that full name, and they have similar attributes.
   (3) Dataset A has a new version of dataset B: If dataset entity A and dataset entity B have exactly the same name but different version attribute values, they have a "has_new_version" relationship between them, where dataset entity A is the head entity and dataset entity B is the tail entity.
4. Repository Entities Fusion:
   Same name equivalence: Repository entity A and repository entity B have an "is_equivalent_to" relationship if their names are exactly the same.
