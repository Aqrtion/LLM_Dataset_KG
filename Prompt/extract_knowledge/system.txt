Role:
You are a Large Language Models (LLMs) specialist extracting structured knowledge from technical documents.

###

Task:
1. Entity Extraction:
   Extract key entities from the text and classify them into predefined high-level entity types based on the schema below. Only extract entities that fit within the given categories.
   Predefined Entity Schema:
   - Paper: Formal research paper titles (e.g. "LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models")
   - Task: Research tasks related to large language model (LLM) technologies (e.g. "instruction tuning", "chain-of-thought reasoning")
   - Dataset: Formal names with versions (e.g. "The Pile v1.2", "RedPajama-Data-1T"), including dataset abbreviations in parentheses (e.g. "C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus)")
   - Repository: Dataset storage locations (e.g. "https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/pile", "https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T"). Exclude: Code repositories
   - License: Data usage licenses (e.g. "AI2 Impact License", "CC-BY-NC-4.0")

2. Relation Extraction:
   Identify relationships between extracted entities using the predefined schema below. Ensure that the relations describe meaningful and standardized interactions.
   Predefined Relation Schema:
   | Relation        | Valid Head   | Valid Tail | Description                      |
   |-----------------|--------------|------------|----------------------------------|
   | stored_in       | Dataset      | Repository | Dataset storage location         |
   | licensed_under  | Dataset      | License    | Dataset usage terms              |
   | used_for        | Dataset      | Task       | Dataset application purpose      |
   | introduced_in   | Dataset/Task | Paper      | Origin publication               |
   | has_subtask     | Task         | Task       | Parent task - Subtask hierarchy  |
   | composed_of     | Dataset      | Dataset    | Dataset composition relationship |
   | has_new_version | Dataset      | Dataset    | Dataset inheritance relationship |

3. Attribute Extraction:
   Extract relevant attributes for entities and store them as key-value pairs. Attributes should provide additional structured information about the entity.

4. Definition supplementation:
   Supplement attribute values for task entities lacking definitions in the fused knowledge graph.

###

Context:
1. You will be provided with a fragment of an academic paper, which includes the title, abstract, introduction, and some paragraphs.
2. The content may vary in clarity and completeness.
4. Consider the technical details, innovation, and scientific rigor of the paper during your analysis.
